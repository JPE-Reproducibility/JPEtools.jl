           README: Replication Package for “Transparency and Percent
           Plans”

           March 14, 2025

           Overview
           The code in this replication package constructs analysis ffles from the restricted-use Texas Higher Education
           Opportunity Project (THEOP) dataset 1 and auxiliary public datasets, then uses these ffles to estimate the
           model described in “Transparency and Percent Plans”, simulate counterfactuals, and produce all numbers
           and exhibits in the paper and appendices. Two main ffles run all of the code to produce the 3 tables and 4
           ffgures in the paper, as well as the 7 tables and 9 ffgures in the Online Appendix.
           The Stata code (master ffle: “code/setup/Master.do”) constructs analysis ffles, as well as some exhibits in
           the paper. The user should expect this code to run for a few minutes.
           The Julia code (master ffle: “code/analysis/TTTnew.jl”) then loads analysis ffles that have been produced by
           the Stata code, runs the remaining analyses, and produces the remaining numbers and exhibits. The user
           should expect this code to run for approximately two days to produce all exhibits. Options are provided so
           that the code may be run in steps.
           Because the data was obtained under a data-use agreement that prohibits sharing, the primary dataset is not
           included in this replication package. Simulated datasets are provided.

           Computational requirements
           Software Requirements
           The code requires:
              •Stata (code was last run with version 15.1)
              •Julia 1.10 (or higher; code was last run with version 1.10.0)
           Several software packages are used.
              •The Stata code usesestout,sutex,tabout, andgeodist. The latest versions (as of October 8, 2024) were
                used.
              •The Julia code uses the packages listed inproject.toml.
                This ffle will programatically install and load the versions of the packages that were used for estimation,
                see https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/.

           Controlled Randomness
           Note: due to the long run-time, the code saves intermediate results at several points, and provides options to
           run parts of the code in blocks, e.g. to load previously-saved parameter estimates and run counterfactuals
           without re-running the estimation routine.
           Accordingly, random seeds are set in multiple places to ensure that each block, e.g. starting values, estimation,
           and counterfactuals, produce identical results, regardless of which blocks have been run in the particular
           session that is open.
              •For the main routine, random seeds are set at lines 18, 62 78, and 90 of program “TTTnew.jl”.
              •For inference (standard errors via the bootstrap), a random seed is set at line 8 of ‘bootstrap_2024.jl”

           Memory, Runtime, Storage Requirements
           Summary The code was run on a PC with two Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2687W v4 3.00 GHz processors,
           with a total of 48 cores and 128 GB of RAM. The operating system was Windows 10 Pro (64-bit).
           The Stata code runs in about a minute and has low memory needs.
           The Julia code runs for approximately two days on this machine, and consumes approximately 70 GB of
           RAM and 100 GB of storage. Memory may be saved by running the code in steps, e.g. estimation ffrst, then
           counterfactuals.
           In Julia, the –threads option was used; the code uses 71 threads on 48 cores.

                                                  3           Description of programs/code
              •Programs incode/setupload and clean the raw data, and produce some exhibits. The Stata ffle
                code/setup/master.dowill run them all, provided that one has access to the restricted datasets.
              •Programs incode/analysisgenerate the remaining ffgures, tables, and numbers in the paper. The
                Julia fflecode/analysis/tttnew.jlwill run them all.
              •Note: after running the Julia code, ffgures and tables will be saved inoutput/Tables. Nontrivial
                numbers will be saved inoutput/Numbers. These are loaded programatically in the paper’s .tex ffles.

           Instructions to Replicators
           To run the code, follow these steps:
              1.Open Stata 15.1. Install the needed packages. Change the paths in code/setup/Master.do, lines 7-12,
                to the appropriate locations. Run code/setup/master.do.
              2.Open Julia 1.10 (or newer). Setreplication packageas the working directory.
              3.ActivateandinstantiateProject.toml. This will install appropriate versions of all needed packages.
               (see https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/).
              4. Open code/analysis/TTTnew.jl. There are sevaral options in lines 5–16. Make sure that
               “use_simdata_approach”, “simulate_data”, “run_tests”, and “load_saved_boot_cutoffs_step2” are
                set tofalse. Make sure that the remaining options are set totrue.
              5.Changemypath(line 20 of TTTnew.jl) to the path to the replication package on your system. In
                addition, make sure that “true_data_path” and “publicTHEOPdatapath” (lines 24 and 26) are set to
                the appropriate locations.
              6.Run “TTTnew.jl”
           Important: The Stata code must be run before the Julia code.
           One may run the Julia code in steps; e.g. one may run estimation but not counterfactuals, or counterfactuals
           but not estimation. To do, set the appropriate ffags in lines 5–16 of “TTTnew.jl” to false. Each step depends
           on the previous steps. For example, if the code has not yet been run with “estimate = true,” then running
           counterfactuals will throw an error.

           List of Exhibits
           The provided code reproduces analogues of all numbers, tables, and ffgures in the paper. However, because
           simulated data is used, the exact values cannot be reproduced.
