### File Paths Report

_Generated on 2025-06-27T19:50:42.159_

**Warning**: Our search on file path types is imperfect and incurs both type 1 and type 2 errors. We aim to strike a reasonable balance between both. The below table is therefore only indicative. Detailed listings can be found in the appendix to this report.

In this table we analyse all files which contain source code (not data and documentation), and we report the grand total of each type of filepath we encountered. 

Please check and replace any `windows` filepaths with unix compliant paths, insofar as this is possible in your setup. (Notice that `STATA` allows `/` to be a filepath separator on a windows platform, hence this is a requirement for *all* `STATA` applications.)



| Files Analyzed | Windows Paths | Unix Paths | Mixed Paths | Drive Letters (`C:\` etc) |
